See at a glance how many commits you've made to your projects since it was last released.

You'll need a GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). It all runs in the browser, so we never see your token.

Features:

- Highlight repos where the new commits are all `dependabot` commits
- Hide repos that are up to date
- Hide repos that have never had a release
